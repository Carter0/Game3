### Game Design Notes 

The player is trapped inside some kind of box. Enemies routinely spawn and the player needs to shoot them as they appear. 
The problem is that the player's bullets can also hurt the player and the bullets bounce around the room. The bullets will only stop bouncing around the room if they are
hit with another bullet or they hit an enemy. 

The player needs to survive as long as possible and rack up a high score.

### Enemies 

Enemies Spawn randomly every 3 seconds or so and the player needs to shoot them.

Questions 
1. How do I randomly spawn enemies the way I want to 
2. How should the enemies behave once spawned

All enemies should spawn in at the edge of the level. In order to get that to work you need to randomly generate 
the correct x and y positions for the enemy to spawn. As to the timing thing I think there is a way to specify a system 
only run x seconds, ill need to double check that tho.

The enemy should slowly follow the player. I think that level of interaction is good enough for now. 
With all the bouncing balls that should be enough challenge.
